# Poker Practice

A 1 person poker game - getting used to card mechanics, graphics, and randomness in JavaScript. This was made as a personal project using JavaScript, HTML and SCSS.

## MVP

-   A system that deals two cards to a player, then deals cards to the centre in the same manner as in poker
-   Ability to fold
-   Ability to see remaining cards
-   Ability to redeal

## Palette and Design

Many poker games online use the same green and red palette, so I decided to go against this and opted for a coral palette generated at coolors.co
#F7B267
#F79D65
#F4845F
#F27059
#F25C54

In order to allow for this, I made the design for the card back on onlinefractaltools.com to imitate the complex designs that commonly appear on the backs of cards.

In addition, I opted for some darker colours to counter the more piercing effect of these colours, especially darker reddish-browns and purples.

## Extensions:

-   Ability to bet
-   Tracking player money
-   Tracking player win rate?
